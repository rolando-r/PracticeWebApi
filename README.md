# PracticeWebApi

🚀 **Welcome to this practice guide for developing a Web API using the recommended folder structure!** In this guide, we will explore how to organize and build a Web API application using the `Api`, `Application`, `Persistence`, and `Domain` folders.

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this practice project is to provide you with hands-on experience in developing a Web API using a structured layered approach. You will learn how to design and build a Web API application with a modular and scalable architecture, using industry best practices.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **Api:** This folder contains your Web API entry point, controllers, and routing configurations.

- **Aplicacion:** This is where the application logic resides. Application services, DTO mappings, validations, and other application layer components are located in this folder.

- **Persistencia:** In this folder you will find the persistence layer, where you will define your database contexts, repositories and migration configurations.

- **Dominio:** Here you define the fundamental business entities and rules for your application.

## 🛠 Skills

C#, .NETCore
